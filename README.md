AlgoRude - The Algorithm Tutor With Attitude
Overview
AlgoRude is a web application that provides a clean, modern interface for interacting with a Google Gemini AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot is designed to answer Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions politely while responding rudely to off-topic queries. The website features a mobile-responsive design, error handling for API failures, and a loading indicator for a seamless user experience. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
